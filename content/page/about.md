I have a passion for web design, and I love helping businesses by using my skills. I value quality content, responsive design, and effective typography.

I freelance and work as a front-end developer at Avita.io, a platform where designers and developers can collaborate on client projects together.

## My Design Philosophy
I mix tried and true methods with original ideas to create a unique product for you. Here are some of the design principles I follow:

### Beautiful Aesthetics
When viewing a website becomes a pleasing experience, visitors become engaged quickly.

### Usable Interface
Easy to use interfaces that clients understand make happy customers.

### Responsive Design
Layouts flawlessly adapt to screen size, connection speed, and touchscreen devices.

### Accessible Markup
An optimal browsing experience is always provided to those with physical impairments.

## Contact Me
If youâ€™re interested in working with me, send me an email at adam@adamblum.us.

You can also find me at the following places:

* [Twitter](#) for ranting and finding good articles on web design.
* [SoundCloud](#) for my music that I record at home

## Colophon
The primary typeface used is Georgia, with some Gill Sans and Andale Mono here and there. I created this website from scratch using :HTML:"" and :CSS:"", with some help from :SASS:"" and Grunt.
