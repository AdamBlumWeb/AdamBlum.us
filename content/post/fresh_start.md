I’m starting the year off with a brand-new blog where I’ll be sharing my thoughts as a web designer and developer with the world.

Whether or not people read my blog isn’t important, I’m mostly doing this for myself. I feel that writing out something you’ve done is a good way to retain the information, and it’s a nice repository of my ideas to go back and look at as time goes on.

I’m sure there will be many edits to the design as I’m getting started here, but that’s okay. I don’t necessarily version out each iteration of my site’s design like some, just because I don’t think it matters since the content’s exactly the same.

I’m deploying this project via [FTPloy](http://ftploy.com), a great tool for pushing Git repositories to your web server with FTP.
