I like simplicity. I *love* minimalist design. I set out to make my new website as lightweight as possible, while retaining flexibility and good-looking design.

## What I’m doing
I’m not only designing for simplicity, I’m [designing for speed](#). And that doesn’t mean I’m ripping out the fun stuff for the sake of performance; I want the site to look good and have its own personality. In this case, it will convey a sense of simplicity and ease of use, since there’s not a lot of stuff to “do” on this site anyway.

There are four key actions that take place on here:

* Read about me
* Read my blog posts
* Look at my portfolio
* Contact me

First of all, that’s mostly reading, so readability took precedence over everything. Then I make design decisions based on my needs. Do I need a complex :UI:"User Interface" for this? No. Do I need a complex backend architecture for this? No. Do I even need a font with multilanguage support? No.

Keeping designs simple and load times fast is more work than you think, though.

## Optimizing Performance
I’m not using a custom typeface (gasp). I just don’t feel like I need one to achieve the goals of my site’s design. I like :HTML:"Hypertext Markup Language".

If Georgia is good enough for The Washington Post, it’s good enough for me. The results on both my site and The Washington Post are the same: type looks gorgeous, it’s very legible, and costs absolutely nothing in performance.
